**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing bike sales across different demographics and regions using Excel. I explored various features and tools within Excel to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to draw insights about the sales patterns.

**Tools and Techniques Covered**
1.  Data Tools: Leveraged Excelâ€™s in-built data tools for efficient handling of data.
2.  Removing Duplicates: Cleaned the dataset by identifying and removing duplicate entries.
3.  Filtering Rows: Applied filters to view and analyze subsets of the data.
4.  IF and Nested IF Statements: Used conditional logic to create dynamic data insights.
5.  Pivot Tables: Summarized data to identify key patterns and trends.
6.  Dashboard Creation: Developed a dashboard to visualize the data and make insights more accessible.

**Analysis Focus**
I aimed to uncover trends in bike sales based on:
-  Demographics: Age groups, gender, marital status, and occupation.
-  Income and Education Levels: Analyzed the influence of these factors on bike purchases.
-  Regions: Explored sales patterns in regions like Europe and the Pacific.

**Visualizations**

I built a dynamic dashboard to highlight:
-  Sales distribution across age groups and income levels.
-  Purchase preferences based on education and occupation.
-  Regional breakdown of bike sales across different demographic categories.

**Conclusion**

This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of how to use Excel for data analysis, particularly in exploring real-world datasets to derive actionable insights.
